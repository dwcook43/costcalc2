            'OPEX', etc.

            The name of the reaction step for which this value will be
            changed. If this is `None` (default), then all the values for the
            given compound (`cpd`) will be set to the same value. This is

            specific reaction. If this parameter is left as `None`, the

        Parameters
        ----------
        See `value_mod` method description, except for the following.

        vals : container of int/float values, int, float
            This is the container of values for which to scan through. If you
            want, this can be a single value, although the `value_mod` method
            may be more appropriate for that.

        -------
        list of floats
            This is the costs associate with each value in the input
            container. 

        Notes
        -----
        Although this method recalculates the cost for every value, it does
        not modify the original `fulldata` attribute. However, the `cost`
        attribute will reflect the final cost calculation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    materials_key : str
        The Google Sheet key to a materials list. This value can be found
        in the URL of the sheet.

    rxn_key : str
        The Google Sheet key to the reaction list. This value can be found
        in the URL of the sheet.

    final_prod : str
        The name of the overall final product of this route. This should
        be the same as a product from the reaction sheet.

    materials_sheet : int, str, optional (default = 0)
        The sheet to pull out of the materials Google Sheet. The default
        (0) is the first sheet in the spreadsheet. You could use a
        different number or a name if you want a different sheet from the
        spreadsheet.

    rxn_sheet : int, str, optional (default = 0)
        See `materials_sheet` description, except this is for the reaction
        Google Sheet.

    alt_mat_key : str, optional (default = None)
        A Google Sheet key for an optional, secondary materials sheet.
        This is useful if you have separate master and user materials
        sheets, for example.

    alt_mat_sheet : int, str, optional (default = 0)
        The sheet number/name for the secondary materials sheet. See
        `materials_sheet` description. 

    Attributes
    ----------
    final_prod : str
        The name of the overall final product of this route.
        
    rxns : DataFrame
        A DataFrame describing the original reactions in the given route. This 
        is idential to the reactions Google Sheet, and is not changed by any 
        of the helper functions in this class.
        
    materials : DataFrame
        A DataFrame describing all of the known materials. This will contain
        all of the materials from both of the given materials Google Sheets.
        
    cost : Numpy Float64
        The final cost of the described route. This value *will* include OPEX
        for the final reaction, if that value is given. 
        
    fulldata : DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing all the costing related values for the given 
        route. If the cost for the route has been calculated and an OPEX was 
        given for the final step, the final product "Cost" *will* include
        this additional OPEX cost. However, the "Cost" values for intermediate
        materials will *not* include this value.

    Notes
    -----
    If there is a missing material or reaction, you'll get a printed
    error. Materials that are marked as being cost calculated will have
    their costs deleted, so they will need reactions defined in order to
    reset their costs.
